# Responsive Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to create a web page with responsive design.  This page will be used as a way to promote myself during the career services/ job search portion of the program. 


## High Level Deliverables 

* I added three new html files/ pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.  Also added a css styling sheet and links to some .jpg and .png images.

* Bootstrap was used to develop the site.  I used code from Bootstrap 4.5 (https://getbootstrap.com/) as well as Bootstrap 4 (https://mdbootstrap.com/).  I like some of the options in Bootstrap 4 for the footer I currently have.

We were instructed to use bootstrap for:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* This was achieved as well as a Bootstrap Footer as mentioned above.

* Contact Me is a form that is not yet active for use.  I believe we will learn more about how to make this active soon.
* Similarly the Portfolio page is a shell.  I hope to make the categories active links to additional pages that reflect and show my projects and showcase my programming work for prospective employers.


### Other Deliverables

* The Bootstrap grid system was used in each main/ section as well as the footers and nac bars.  Basically the entire page for each site leverages Bootstrap.  Footer is using code from Bootstrap 4.
    * This helped keep the layout consistent from page to page and leveraging Bootstrap keeps the site responsive for all devices/ consoles.

* I used the https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea to validate the html code.  The main errors I originally found I corrected.  I left the following:
   * Index - There is a link in the header I needed to insert to get my LinkedIn link to work.  While the HTML validator said the type wasn't necessary, I am following the instructions LinkedIn provided.  Also in the Main/ Section portion.... the validator was looking for Header.  The Headers exist in some areas but I don't think they are needed in all.  Also I may have over used the Section element.  Please let me know. 
   * Contact (same as first part of index) - There is a link in the header I needed to insert to get my LinkedIn link to work.  While the HTML validator said the type wasn't necessary, I am following the instructions LinkedIn provided. 
   * Portfolio (same as first part of index) - There is a link in the header I needed to insert to get my LinkedIn link to work.  While the HTML validator said the type wasn't necessary, I am following the instructions LinkedIn provided. 


### Minimum Requirements

* (check) Functional, deployed application.

* (check) GitHub repository with README describing the project.

* (check) Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* (check) Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* (check) All links must work.

* (check) to the best of my ability) Must use semantic html.

* (check) used https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* (check) Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* (I believe I did) Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


### Bonus

* The sticky footer did not look right when I added it.  I will continue to research as this maybe something I add down the road, but for now it is not active.
